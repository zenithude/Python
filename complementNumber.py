Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary
representation.



Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to
output 2.



Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to
output 0.



Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
    This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
